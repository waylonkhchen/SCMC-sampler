1. Requirements are in ./API/Requirements_conda.txt or ./API/Requirements_pip.txt

2. The solution to the challenge is in ./API/script.py

3. An example of the prompt
$python3 script.py ../example.txt example_sample.txt 1000

is supposed to be executed when working directory is at ./API
the first argument "../example.txt" is the input, second argument "example_sample.txt" is the output file path
third argument 1000 is the number of feasible points one would like to sample.


4. The explanation of solution that introduces the methodology is at ./explanation_of_solution/

5. The file ./API/Using_API_example.py shows how to use the API SCMC in python3 shell
